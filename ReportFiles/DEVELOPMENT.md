# Development Log

### Week 1: 
    During Week 1, we started to design the classes for our project. The first classes we started with were the Matrix.cpp and LLE.cpp classes. Over the week, we planned out
    and determined what functions each class needed, how we were going to implement each function, and who was going to implement each function. Once we determined who was going
    to work on what, each team member started brainstorming how we were going to write code for the various functions. By the end of the week, we were ready to start designing the 
    two classes.

### Week 2:
    During Week 2, we started writing the code for the Matrix.cpp and LLE.cpp classes. The Matrix.cpp class took much longer to implement then we expected. The various functions 
    included in the class had tricky logic that led to many bugs in our code. Furthermore, we faced various difficulties with the design of our class that set us back in our progress.
    This week we weren't able to make much progress on the LLE.cpp class aside from creating the class and adding some basic functions. We weren't able to implement these functions
    since we were focusing on finishing up the Matrix.cpp class.

### Week 3:
    During Week 3, we started and finished the code for our Graph class. The main challenge we faced when it came to the Graph class was how to design it in a clean fashion. We came to an
    agreement that the best way to do this would be to create various structs in order to add a level of abstraction to our class. As a result of this, we created both Edge and Node structs 
    in our Graph class and utilized them in our implementation. For the Graph Class, we had to implement Dijkstra's algorithm, MST using Prim's Algorithm, and DFS. 
    Implementing the Graph algorithms wasn't too time consuming for us since before implementing we had a clear idea of how we were going to implement each function. Furthermore, 
    the design of our Graph class aided our ability to complete the Graph algorithms quickly. Lastly, we started working on our Makefile since up until now we had been individually 
    compiling our files.

### Week 4:
    During Week 4, we created the heuristic to determine the distance between two images which we reduced to the simple problem of finding the distance between two pixels. We started writing
    tests for our various classes and finished up our LLE class. Altered Graph class to take into account double as opposed to integer weights. Fixed Makefile in order to properly account for new classes. 

### Week 5:
    During Week 5, we finished LLE testing and Matrix testing. Ensured to account for edge cases in both classes. Ran LLE algorithm on Dataset and outputted results. Implemented MST and Dijkstra's on the outputted dataset. Added command line functionality to program. Recorded presentation video and finished up report files.
