# Results

We tested the results of our code using two methods: One that utilized Dijkstra's algorithm and one that utilized a Minimum Spanning Tree. We tested both of our implementations of Dijkstra's algorithm and our Minimum Spanning Tree in our /Tests directory. After comparing the animations produced from Dijkstra's algorithm with the animations produced from the Minimum Spanning Tree, we found that the Dijkstra's algorithm animation was smoother. We were expecting this animation to be very smooth since the particular verison of Dijkstra's algorithm found the smoothest path. The animation produced from the Minimum Spanning Tree, however, was not as good as we expected it to be. We expected the Minimum Spanning Tree to have a very smooth animation since it found the best way to span all of the animations for a particular image, but this was not the case. However, in the end, we were surprised by the overall accuracy of Dijkstra's algorithm and Local Linear Embedding when it came to find smooth animations. As a part of the development stage of this project, we discovered many new things such as the optimal number of images to use in an animation and the optimal K-sized ball.
