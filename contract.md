# Team Contract (as75-kylend2-shyammt2-rahulsr2)

## Communication

### 1.  Team Meetings

We will meet via calls over Discord once every week, for about an hour to make sure everyone is on the same page, and additionally as is desired or convenient.

  

### 2.  Assistance

Our primary form of communication will be Discord. In terms of response time, when a teammate reaches out to another team member, we expect them to respond within the day.

  
  

### 3. Respect

We will ensure that every member has an opportunity to speak out by allowing each team member to share their ideas during meetings. Furthermore, we will encourage each member to utilize Discord to share their ideas and communicate with others. Each team member will be expected to respect the ideas of others and genuinely consider them. In order to ensure this happens, we will enforce a system where those who aren’t actively engaged will be reported. A three-strike penalty system will be utilized for the sake of trying to initially solve conflicts within the group. If the three strikes are reached, then the course staff will be contacted to report the team member who has not been actively participating or engaging in the project. No disrespectful slander will be tolerated and will immediately be reported to the course staff.

  
  
  

## Collaboration

  

### 1. Work Distribution

Each week, the necessary deliverables for the week will be determined

by the full team and each member will volunteer to work on one or more deliverables. When

no one volunteers, two team members will be randomly assigned to work on the task as a

paired-programming team. If this leads to an unbalanced workload for the week, adjustments

can be made on a case-by-case basis.

  

### 2. Time Commitment

  

To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member is expected to

independently work no less than two and no more than six hours per week on the project.

If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be pulled in to assist

with the unforeseen complication, with each member taking an equal share of the workload or

programming in pairs. It is the team’s responsibility, not the individual’s responsibility, to

make sure a weekly deliverable is finished by the end of the week.

However if a team member is habitually not completing their tasks, they may be asked –

politely – to explain their circumstances. Based on their explanation, further actions, such

as alerting a staff member, may be taken on a case-by-case basis decided by the other team

members.

  

### 3. Conflict Resolution

When a disagreement arises amongst team members, we will resolve the conflict by allowing each team member to openly express their ideas to the rest of the team. After each member expresses their ideas, the team as a whole will come to an agreement. If a team member fails to work on the project, then we will first try to reach out to the team member to figure out why this is the case. If a team member consistently shows up late, we will utilize the punishment system as described in the “Respect” section of the contract. If a team member fails to show up to meetings on multiple occasions and is not reachable via any of the contact methods described above, then we will contact course staff as a last resort.
